Using functions
==========

In previous installments of the course notes, we've seen the `print` and `input` functions.

Functions make up the main building blocks of our programsâ€”they are re-usable pieces of code that are nicely wrapped up for us. For instance, the implementation of the `print` function may have 50 lines of code, it may only have 2. We don't know and we don't care. To use it, we just have to write `print("my fantastic message")`. When we use a function, we say that we "call" that function.

We can give the general format for using functions in two ways:

```python
# functions with return values
return_value = function_name(parameters)

# functions without return values
function_name(parameters)
```

Take a look at some examples using the `input()` and `print()` functions that we've already visited. Remember that the `input()` function does have a return value and the `print()` function does not.


```python
# an example with a return value
result = input("here's a prompt? ")

# an example without a return value
print("here's a sentence")
```

If we forget the parentheses, the function will not run. What will happen in this case depends on if it is a [built-in function](../3/builtin_functions.html) like `input()` and `print()` or a [function that you have written yourself](../4/writing_functions.html).



Parameters/Arguments
------------

You'll notice that we use the words "parameters" and "arguments" pretty much interchangeably to refer to the same thing. This is ok!

__Parameters__: the values that a function takes and uses to perform its task. (further refined [later in this chapter](../5/writing_functions_parameters.html))

For instance, `print("my message")` will print out the text `my message`.

Some functions have a fixed number of parameters that they take. For example, the `len()` function only takes 1 parameter.

Some functions can take a variable number of parameters. For example, we can write `print()`, `print("hello")`, and `print("hello", "there")`. When you use a function with a different number of parameters, it's behavior will be slightly different.

Notice that when we provide multiple parameters to a function, we use a comma (`,`) to separate them.

<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code, what does the len() function do?
# Answer: 
print(len("hello"))

```
</div>

</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code, what happens if you run the len function 
# with more than one parameter?
# Answer: 
print(len("hello", "there"))

```
</div>

</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code, what happens if you run the len function 
# with no parameters?
# Answer: 
print(len())

```
</div>

</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: compare and contrast calls to print() with variable numbers of
# parameters
print("hello") # one parameter
print() # zero parameters
print("hellothere") # one parameter
print("hello", "there") # two parameters

# what happens if you pass 3 strings to the print function?

```
</div>

</div>



Functions without return values
----------------

Our best example of a function without a return value is `print()`. 

We call functions without return values like:

```python
function_name(parameters)
```


Out of curiousity, let's investigate this lack-of-return-value more.



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code.
# If we try to save a return value for a function that doesn't
# have one, what happens?
# Answer:

print("first message")
print_return = print("second message")

```
</div>

</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
print("first message")
print_return = print("second message")

# now let's investigate the value of the print_return variable
# TODO: print out the value of print_return
print(print_return)

```
</div>

</div>



This shows us that if a function doesn't have a return value and we try to save it anyways, we get a special python value called `None`.



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code
print(type(None))

```
</div>

</div>



`None` is a value that isn't any of our 4 basic types (`int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`). In fact, it is its own type. `None` is a special value that literally represents nothing. We'll get into this more later in the course.



Functions with return values
----------------

A great example of a function _with_ a return value is `input()`. `len()` also has a return value. In fact, _most_ functions that we will use in this course, and especially [python's built-in functions](../3/builtin_functions.html) have return values.

*__Remember: if you do not save a return value in a variable, you cannot use it later!__*



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code, why do you get an error?
# Answer:
input("Do you own a labradoodle?")
print(answer)

```
</div>

</div>



When we call functions with return values, we use the format:

```python
return_value = function_name(parameters)
```



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: use the len() function to find the length of your favorite 
# strings, then add these lengths 
# together and report them to the user.

```
</div>

</div>



String functions
-----------

Of course, it would be too simple if all functions worked exactly the same way. 

Since strings are objects, when we call a string function, what we are doing is saying "hey, string! Give me the information that I want!". What this means is that we need a string that has already been created (an instance of a string) to call string functions.

The general format for string functions is:

```python
string_var = "any string value"
return_value = string_var.function_name(parameters)
```

Let's look at an example: the string `islower()` function.

```python
my_string = "I am a string!"
result = my_string.islower()
print(result)
```

What this string is doing is saying "Hey, `my_string` variable! I want you to tell me if you are lower case!"

Another example: the string `lower()` function.

```python
my_string = "I am a string!"
result = my_string.lower()
print(result)
```

What this string is doing is saying "Hey, `my_string` variable! I want you to give me back the lower case version of yourself!"



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code
my_string = "I am a string!"
result = my_string.islower()
print(result)

```
</div>

</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this code
# then modify this code to test whether the variable
# result is lower case or not. Print out your final assessment.
my_string = "I am a string!"
result = my_string.lower()
print(result)

```
</div>

</div>



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: now let's look at a tricky strings trap.
# print out the length of the following string,
# then print out the lower
# case version of it.
s = "I AM A STRING SUCH A STRINGY STRING STRING"

```
</div>

</div>
