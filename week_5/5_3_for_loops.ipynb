    "`for` Loops\n",
    "=======\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop is a control structure that we use to repeat certain pieces of code (and avoid all that copy-pasting).\n",
    "\n",
    "__control structure__: a part of the language that allows us to dictate when and how (and how many times) certain pieces of code are run. We can consider functions to be one time of control structure. (Though they are so important that they just get to be called functions most of the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the syntax of a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable_name in [options_list]:\n",
    "    # do things\n",
    "    print(variable_name) # for example, print each element\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"done\") # this is outside of the for loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important pieces here:\n",
    "1. `variable_name` this will be how we access the next value in the sequence that we are iterating over.\n",
    "2. `[options_list]` this is a sequence of values. The `for` loop will iterate (repeat) once per value in this list.\n",
    "3. __indentation__: notice that everything that we want repeated __must__ be indented \"inside\" the `for` loop. Once we return to our base level of indentation, the code will no longer be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an example that we can run."
