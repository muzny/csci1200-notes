The Lambeth water company drew its water upriver from where sewage was discharged into the River Thames. Its water was relatively clean.

In data science, the purpose of writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry out the steps of an analysis. Computers cannot study the world on their own.

We can consider functions to be one type of control structure. (Though they are so important that they just get to be called functions most of the time).
