    "`while` Loops\n",
    "=======\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is a control structure (similar to how a conditional statement is a control structure) that we use to repeat certain pieces of code (and avoid all that copy-pasting).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use while loops to repeat a block of code either a _predetermined_ number of times or an _unknown_ number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that something is happening a _predetermined_ number of times this could be two different scenarios:\n",
    "1. There is a specific number that you, the programmer, knows and can write down. e.g. \"I want to do task X 5 times\"\n",
    "2. There is a specific number that the code knows and can calculate. e.g. \"I want to do task X once per letter in the user's input\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that something is happening an _unknown_ number of times, this means that neither the programmer nor the code knows how many times that will be. Take a look at the following examples.\n",
    "- \"I want to do task X until the user enters the number zero\"\n",
    "- \"I want to roll a 6-sided die until I get a 6\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these scenarios, it is impossible for us to know or calculate how many times we'll need to complete task X ahead of time."

    "Syntax\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the syntax of a `while` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while logical_expression:\n",
    "    # do things\n",
    "    print(1) # for example, print the number 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(\"done\")  # this is outside the while loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important pieces here:\n",
    "1. `logical_expression` this will be how our program determines whether or not the loop needs to be run again. It's the same as a logical expression in an `if` statement!\n",
    "2. __indentation__: notice that everything that we want repeated __must__ be indented \"inside\" the `while` loop. Once we return to our base level of indentation, the code will no longer be repeated.\n",

    "A \"Standard\" `while` Loop\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the pieces that we've just gone over and combine them to create a \"standard\" formula for a `while` loop. Not all `while` loops will look exactly like this, but the vast majority will!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this formula, we'll call the variable that we use to determine if the loop is done or not our \"tracker\" variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tracker = value  # 1) initialize the tracker variable\n",
    "while logical_expression: # 2) are we done? \n",
    "    # code that we want repeated goes here\n",
    "    tracker = new_value  # 3) update the value of our tracker variable \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to clarify each of these important steps:\n",
    "1. __initialize__: we need to set our tracker variable to an initial value that will let our while loop begin. This must happen before (\"outside\") of the while loop. If we are repeating code 10 times, we might initialize this to 0, indicating that the loop has iterated 0 times so far.\n",
    "2. __are we done?__: test the tracker variable's value against some other value. For instance, the test `tracker < 10` would say \"run this loop until the value of `tracker` is 10 or more. Always double check this test!\n",
    "3. __update__: make sure that inside your loop you update the variable that you are testing in step 2 in some way! If you leave this out, this will create an infinite loop! For our running example, this update would be `tracker = tracker + 1` or `tracker += 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples from the outlined steps above would create a while loop as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tracker = 0  # 1) initialize the tracker variable\n",
    "while tracker < 10: # 2) are we done? \n",
    "    # so that we can see the loop progressing in this example\n",
    "    print(tracker)  \n",
    "    tracker = tracker + 1  # 3) update the value of our tracker variable \n",
    "```  \n",
