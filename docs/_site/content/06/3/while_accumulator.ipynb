    "The Accumulator Pattern\n",
    "==============\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing `while` loops, in addition to the patterns covered in section 6.2, there will be one more pattern that we will see over and over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"accumulator\" pattern. This is the pattern that we will use whenever we want to build up a value across iterations of a loop. This is different than the \"tracker\" variable because the accumulated value (typically) doesn't control how many times the loop iterates. Rather, it *gathers information* as the loop iterates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, for example, that we want to know the sum of the numbers from 0 to 99."
