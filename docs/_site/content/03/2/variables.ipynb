    "Variables are how our programs are going to remember information. Our variables have two parts: __names__ and __values__. When we create a variable we set its name and assign it an initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name *__always__* goes on the left of the equals sign and the value *__always__* goes on the right of the equals sign. If you switch these you will get an error!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I want a variable called `age` to have the value `91`, I would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 91\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use any name for our variables as long as they begin with a letter. Ideally, we want names that are descriptive of the values that the variables hold. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_var = 1\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# notice that we separate words with \n",
    "# underscores to improve readability!\n",
    "flying_purple_people_eater = 3 \n",
    "\n",
    "secrets = 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've declared a variable, we can then use its value later in our program. For instance, if I want to print out the value of a variable, I need to pass the variable as the argument of the print function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(variable)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So for our example with the variable `age`, a completed example would have the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 91 # declare the variable first\n",
    "print(age) # now I can print it out\n",
