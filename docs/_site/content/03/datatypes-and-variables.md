When we are writing programs in python, we will be combining different functions (like the `print` function that we've already seen) with various values (like "hello") so that our programs can perform whatever task we've designed them for.  
  
In this unit, we'll go over __data types__, __variables__, and how to change a value from one type to another (__casting__). These are the building blocks for how we will enter values into our programs, control how and when they are updated, and use them throughout our programs.  

  
These concepts are quite important.
