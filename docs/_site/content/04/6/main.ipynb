    "The `main` function\n",
    "==============\n",
    "\n",
    "When any program is executed, the kernel needs to know where to start running code. Since python is a scripting language, the programs that we write are executed from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start writing more complex programs, it is best to keep our code well-organized by having all code inside of functions. However, if all our code is inside of functions, this begs the question of where should we put the code that actually calls our functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, we do this by writing a special function called `main()` that takes no parameters and has no return value. Once we've defined `main()`, we just need to call that function to run our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example using the first program that we wrote:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    # code to run our program goes here\n",
    "    print(\"This is a program.\")\n",
    "    print(\"It has three print statements.\")\n",
    "    print(\"They are executed from top to bottom.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "main()  # call our main function to run the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a more complex example where we are calling functions that we have defined ourselves:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "# this is code from section 4.4\n",
    "def analyze_name():\n",
    "    name = input(\"What is your name? \")\n",
    "    name_len = len(name)\n",
    "    print(\"Your name is \" + str(name_len) + \" characters long!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    # code to run our program goes here\n",

    "    analyze_name()\n",
    "    \n",
    "main()  # call our main function to run the program\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `main` function should be a concise summary of what your program does, similarly to a table of contents in a book. Having a `main` function also adds nice structure to our program--it tells future programmers (and our TAs) where to look to see what's happening when our program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We care about writing well-structured code and you should too!\n",
    "\n",
    "*__From Homework 3 onwards, you will be required to have a `main` function__*\n",
    "\n",
