    "Data Types\n",
    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous installments of these notes, we've alluded to something called \"data types\". All values in python have a _type_. Intuitively, the number 7 and the piece of text \"saber-toothed tiger\" are not the same type of value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 basic (or primitive) types in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "| type    | short name | example values                                                                                |\n",
    "|---------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| integer | int        | -10, -7, -4, 0, 2, 13, 1117, 98372                                                            |\n",
    "| float   | float      | -5.3, -4.0, -0.756, 0.0, 1.25, 12386.2                                                        |\n",
    "| string  | str        | \"hello\", \"sentences are strings\",   \"3.0\", \"remember to start your homework early!\" |\n",
    "| boolean | bool       | True, False                                                                                   |\n",
    " \n",
    "There are some more types, but we can do a lot with just these 4 for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important for us to know about and understand the different types because certain operations are only allowed between certain types (for instance, we can't divide a `string` by another `string`, what would that even mean?) and because the behavior and structure of our programs is going to depend in part on the types of our variables."

    "Integers\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are all whole numbers. As soon as there is a decimal point, the number is no longer an `int`, it's a `float` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Numbers that you might be used to writing with a comma (such as 1,000,000) are written as `1000000` in python. This is because python would try to interpret `1,000,000` as three separate numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are all numbers with a decimal point. Even `1.0` and `6.0` and `-7.0`!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also hear floats referred to as \"doubles\". This is a second name that comes from the history of computers and programming languages. This is because floats and doubles represent two different ways to store high-precision (decimal) numbers behind the scenes. We don't have to worry about this because of advancements in computer architectures!\n",

    "Strings\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we call all sequences of characters (letters, but including the numbers and symbols like `\"1\"` and `\"@\"`) strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there are *__always__* quotation marks around strings. It's important to know the difference because the int `3` acts very differently than the string `\"3\"`!\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, we can enclose strings in either single quotes `'like this'` or double quotes `\"like this\"`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Boolean values are *__only__* the values `True` or `False`. We can use them to represent all sorts of useful things like whether or not to execute a particular block of code. (We'll talk a lot more about boolean values later when we talk about conditionals.)\n",
