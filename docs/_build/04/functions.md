Functions are the basic building blocks of all the programs that we write. They are the first major __control structure__ that we will study. A control structure is code that dictates which line(s) of code will be executed at a particular point in a program.

A __function__ is a conveniently packaged set of instructions (lines of code) that together accomplish some common operation.  
  
We've seen functions already with the `print()` function and the casting functions. Now we'll learn about both how to use other functions that are already provided by python ("built-in" functions) and how to write our very own functions.

Warning! Functions can be a confusing topic. A good understanding of functions is vital to programming in any language, so making sure to carefully go through this material is essential.
