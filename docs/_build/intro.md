Introduction to Computational Thinking in Python
=====================

__By [Felix Muzny](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~muzny/)__



# What are these notes?

This set of notes is meant to supplement lecture and lab materials. They are not intended to be sufficient standalone material to master python or the other concepts covered in class.

These notes are a great place to review concepts that we've been over in class and to play around with code. The examples that are given in these notes are great places to start if you are confused about a topic or would like to discuss how a specific example of code works.



# Working with these notes

In these notes you'll see code in three different ways:  
1. Non-interactive: embedded in text inline like `print("hello")`.
2. Non-interactive: embedded in it's own code block.
```python
print("ahoy")
```
3. Interactive: in a editable, runnable block. (Notice that there is __both__ a "interactive mode" and a "copy" icon in the upper right of this block. This makes it easy for you to copy+paste this code into a Jupyter Notebook on your computer.)



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run this cell by clicking "interactive mode", 
# then clicking the "run" button
print("greetings")

```
</div>

</div>
