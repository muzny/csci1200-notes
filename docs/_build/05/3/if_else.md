`if/else` statements
==============

`if` statements have multiple ways that we can customize them (other than changing the logical expression): the first of these ways is by adding an `else` clause to our statement.

The syntax of `if/else` statements is:

```python
if logical_expression:
    # do something
else:
    # do something different
```



<div markdown="1" class="cell code_cell">
<div class="input_area" markdown="1">
```python
# TODO: run me! Under what circumstances is "big number" printed out?
# What about "small number"?
# Answer:

number = int(input("number? "))

if number > 100:
    print("big number")
else:
    print("small number")
    
print("done")

```
</div>

</div>



Notice that what makes this statement different than [in the previous section](02_if_statements.ipynb) is that either "big number" or "small number" is _always_ printed. After one of the two is printed, then we finish by printing "done".

We can think of this as a fork in the road that has a left and right option for paths that then rejoin each other.
