    "Lists can get pretty complex, so we're going to start with the basics. A python list is fundamentally very similar to a list that you would write on a piece of paper. Lists have a certain number of items (elements) that are in a certain order. We can do things like access the 3rd element in the list, add a new item to our list, remove items from our list, and so on and so forth.\n",
