    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, when we talked about [the input function](../1/input.html), we introduced return values. When we learned how to [use functions](../2/using_functions.html#functions-with-return-values), we also learned about calling functions with return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're going to write functions with return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to how we can think of parameters as __input__ to a function, we can think of a return value as __output__ from a function."
